            <p>
                Welcome to Stamp Stock Register ("App", "we", "our", or "us"). We are committed to protecting your
                privacy and providing a transparent understanding of how our application operates. This Privacy Policy
                explains our practices regarding data collection, usage, and protection.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Important Notice:</strong> Stamp Stock Register is designed with your privacy as a top priority.
                The App operates entirely offline, does not collect any personal data, and does not transmit any

            <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
                We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect, store, transmit, or process any personal information. This includes
                but is not limited to:

            <h2>3. Internet Connectivity</h2>
            <p>
                Stamp Stock Register operates completely <strong>offline</strong> and does not require internet
                connectivity for its core functionality. The App:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does not connect to the internet</li>
                <li>Does not send or receive data over the network</li>
                <li>Does not communicate with external servers</li>
                <li>Does not integrate with online services or APIs</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Exception:</strong> Internet connectivity is only used for processing in-app purchases through
                Google Play's secure payment system. This connection is handled entirely by Google Play and is not
                controlled by our App.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>
                Stamp Stock Register offers optional in-app purchases to unlock premium features. When you make an
                in-app purchase:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The transaction is processed securely by Google Play</li>
                <li>We do not have access to your payment information</li>
                <li>We do not store credit card or payment details</li>
                <li>Google Play handles all billing information according to their privacy policy</li>
                <li>Purchase records are maintained by Google Play, not by our App</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For information about how Google Play handles your payment data, please refer to the
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

        <section>
            <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
            <p>
                Stamp Stock Register requires minimal permissions to function. Any permissions requested are used solely
                for the App's local functionality and do not involve data transmission. The App may request:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save and retrieve your stamp inventory data locally on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Billing (In-app purchases):</strong> To process optional premium feature purchases through
                    Google Play</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not request or use any other permissions that could compromise your privacy, such as camera,
                microphone, contacts, or location access (unless specifically required for App functionality and clearly
                disclosed).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                Since all your data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted, the security of your data
                depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a secure lock screen on your device</li>
                <li>Keeping your device's operating system up to date</li>
                <li>Regularly backing up your device data to prevent data loss</li>
                <li>Being cautious when granting app permissions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We implement industry-standard security practices in our App's code to protect against unauthorized
                access to locally stored data.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                Stamp Stock Register does not integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics tools, or
                advertising networks. The only external service interaction is with Google Play for in-app purchase
                processing, which is governed by Google's privacy policy.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Our App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
                Since no data is collected or transmitted, the App is safe for use by individuals of all ages. However,
                in-app purchases should be supervised by parents or guardians.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>
                Since all data is stored locally on your device:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have complete control over your data</li>
                <li>You can delete data at any time through the App's interface or by uninstalling the App</li>
                <li>Uninstalling the App will permanently remove all locally stored data</li>
                <li>We do not retain any copies of your data on our servers (because we don't collect any)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal
                reasons. When we make changes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
                <li>Significant changes will be communicated through the App or App store listing</li>
                <li>Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                privacy.

            <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                Since we do not collect any personal data, traditional data privacy rights (such as access, correction,
                deletion, or data portability) do not apply in the conventional sense. However:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have complete ownership of all data stored on your device</li>
                <li>You can export, backup, or delete your data at any time</li>
                <li>You have full control over the App's permissions on your device</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>12. Legal Compliance</h2>
            <p>
                Our App is designed to comply with major privacy regulations including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li>
                <li>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</li>
                <li>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</li>
                <li>Other applicable data protection laws</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Compliance is straightforward as we do not collect, process, or store any personal data.
            </p>
